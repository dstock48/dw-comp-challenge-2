# Static Comp Challenge 2

### Project Description
The goal of this project was to create a responsive webpage closely following the design of the original comp provided to me. The general page layout must adhere to the original comp however copy, images, icons, and colors were left to my discretion. Media query breakpoints were detirmined based upon the flow of the content, and mobile layout decisions were made to intuitively reposition page elements for smaller screens.
